\page bitrl_example_14 Example 14 Simulate a differential drive system with Chrono

In this example we will create a differential drive system and simulate it using the
<a href="https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono">Chrono</a> library.
Specifically, the robot we will simulate has

- Two motorised wheels
- An ultrasound sensor

In order to be able to run this example you need to configure bitrl with Chrono support
